# ML Classification Models

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating **classical machine learning classification workflows** on various datasets. The core focus is on **end-to-end processes**, ranging from **data cleaning and preprocessing to comprehensive model evaluation**, all presented with hands-on examples in each notebook.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
* **Comprehensive Data Preprocessing:** Strategies for handling missing values, robust outlier detection, and effective feature scaling techniques.
* **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Methods for generating impactful new features, efficient encoding of categorical variables, and practical dimensionality reduction techniques.
* **Diverse Algorithm Coverage:** Practical exercises and implementations of key classification algorithms including **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.
* **Modular Notebook Structure:** **5-6 standalone Jupyter notebooks**, each dedicated to exploring a unique dataset and illustrating a complete ML workflow.

## ðŸ“Š Metrics & Evaluation
Models within this repository are rigorously evaluated using standard classification metrics to ensure robust performance assessment:
* **Accuracy:** For overall correctness of predictions.
* **Precision & Recall:** To effectively balance false positives and false negatives, crucial for various real-world scenarios.
* **F1 Score:** Providing a harmonized measure of a model's precision and recall.
Each notebook includes detailed comparisons across these metrics to facilitate the selection of the best-performing model for the specific problem.

## ðŸ”§ Workflow Highlights
* **Missing Data Handling:** Implementation of various imputation strategies (e.g., mean/median filling, model-based imputation).
* **Strategic Feature Engineering:** Creation of interaction terms, target encoding, and systematic feature selection methods.
* **Consistent Model Training:** Adherence to robust train-test splits and cross-validation setups to ensure reliable model generalization.
* **Metric-Driven Evaluation:** Focused on metric-driven model selection and insightful validation curve analysis.

## ðŸ”® Next Steps
To further enhance these classification models and workflows, future integrations may include:
* Integrating more advanced ensemble algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM).
* Implementing automated hyperparameter tuning techniques (e.g., GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV, Optuna).
* Exploring sophisticated imbalance handling techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) for skewed datasets.
